## Documentation

 *Remember that doing a flex 1 will fill out your remaining space of you container. You were having this issue when trying to create 16x16 grid. Right now in the 16x16 you do not need flex because height and minWidth is taking care of the sizes and the wrap is filling the container evenly.*

 *Remember that the code that is local cannot be used outside its scope or globally. For e.g smallBox is inside for loop and I had to write the event listener inside it, for it to work.*
