### **REPLACING DIV FIXED**
- For this one this is what I did.
    1. When the user clicks the button and inputs his data, the mainDiv contents gets cleared away.
    2. Like this `mainDiv.textContent = '';`
    3. Than the data entered by the user gets sent to the loop where it creates a newGridDiv and displays its contents inside the mainDiv.
